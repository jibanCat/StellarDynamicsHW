# StellarDynamicsHW
Homework I wrote in `Sympy`.  
This course is stellar dynamics in National Taiwan University... Hope it would be helpful for newcomer in NTU Astrophysics who hate to write HWs in pen.

I would also like to add new repo for future HW of my PhD. Physics HW is a best place to practice `Sympy` ðŸ˜†, though some professors or TAs might hate me.
